# Backup Directory Guide
## Summary
This directory is the sole receptacle for `backup files` generated by the `save function` provided by each `Tracker` object. These files are simple JSON lists that contain the `MediaIds` being tracked by their respective tracker. This functionality is designed to minimize headache from having to re-track show lists in between server shutdowns.

## System Interaction
### Saving
When desired, the `save function` makes a given `Tracker` compile a list of all `MediaIds` currently being tracked, convert this list to a JSON object, and then **asynchronously** write to a respective `backup file`.

### Loading
When desired, a `Tracker's` respective `load function` will attempt to **asynchronously** read from a target `backup file`. On success, the system will then re-track (using the dedicated `track` function) every `MediaId` listed in the `backup file` that is not currently being tracked. Duplicates, non-airing shows, and other edge cases are handled by the `track` function. Likewise, as this is not a hard rewrite, shows currently being tracked that are not in the `backup file` will not be removed. This results in a non-destructive loading process.

### File Naming Convention
File names are generated using a tracker's unique `Guild ID` (AKA `guid`) followed by the `_backup.json` suffix. Because these `guid` values are provided by **Discord's API**, they are assumed to be unique.
